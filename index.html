Hello to project page...<br>
It is my interpretation WEB 3.0:<br>

This is decentralized interface for persons:<br>
<hr>
Person = app.<br>
For create your person you must clone(fork) golden person<br>
Golden person link: <a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/golden-person-sj3ov">https://codesandbox.io/s/golden-person-sj3ov</a><br>
After you create your person you get unique ID, you can set Secret in app script(default "123") it is head of your person<br>
And you can send message to other person, if (secret match) then message will post in other person body<br>
<br><hr>
Now i will make something beaty, and more readable and more simple for underestanding for this app, but functionality work
